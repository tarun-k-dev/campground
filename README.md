Introduction

I created this web application called “CampGround”. By using “CampGround” web app, user can share the location for camping and show the location for camping to other users. So, users who are new to camping can also find the location easily and be assure about the area. User can search according to the location to find the ground for camping.
Main purpose of this web app to give users a privilege to do camping together by sharing the location to the other users and let them know there is a location for camping. User can also give reviews and suggestion by which other users be aware of the circumstances that may come during camping.
Core Modules:
• Sign-Up Module: In this module, there are two fields username and password. User have to fill both the fields in order to do registration.
• Sign-In Module: After Registration, user can login using username and password.
• Search Module: After Sign-In, user can search for campground according to the location.
• Create a New CampGround Module: After Sign-In, user can share the information about the campground and by doing that other users are able to see that campground.
